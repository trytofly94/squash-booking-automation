## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Network Connectivity
- **Issue**: Intermittent network timeouts during deployment
- **Impact**: Could not complete `git push` and `gh pr create` operations
- **Workaround**: All code is committed locally and ready for manual push
- **Next Steps**: Retry git push and PR creation when network is stable

### Dependencies
- **Issue**: npm install timeout during deployment
- **Impact**: Tests could not be executed in final validation
- **Status**: All dependencies are properly configured in package.json
- **Resolution**: Run `npm install && npm test` after network issues resolve

## 📋 Manual Steps Required

Due to network connectivity issues, the following steps need to be completed manually:

1. **Push to Remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat: Complete Playwright-based squash booking automation system" \
     --body "Complete implementation of Playwright-based squash booking automation"
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies & Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
   npm run test:playwright
   ```

4. **Verify Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Resolve network issues and complete git push/PR creation
2. **Testing**: Run full test suite to validate all functionality
3. **Review**: Code review and approval process
4. **Deployment**: Merge to main and deploy to production environment
5. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for production usage
